        <p>Puto bumbong is a traditional Filipino purple rice cake, often associated with the Simbáng Gabí Christmas season devotion.</p>
        <p>It is traditionally made from a special purple glutinous rice called pirurutong (though food coloring can also be used as a substitute) that is steamed in bamboo tubes, known as bumbong ng kawayan.</p>
        <p>The cooked rice cake is typically served on a pre-cut banana leaf and topped with a spread of margarine or butter, a sprinkle of muscovado sugar, and generous amounts of freshly grated coconut. Some modern variations also add cheese or condensed milk.</p>
